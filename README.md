# AIML Group Project – Preprocessing Pipeline  
Project Title: The Dark Side of Social Media – Predicting Time-Wasting Habits Using AI  

---

# Overview of the Project
This project explores how social media usage habits contribute to time-wasting behavior and reduced productivity.  
Our goal is to preprocess the dataset, clean it, and prepare it for machine learning models that can predict user addiction levels and time-wasting patterns.  

The preprocessing pipeline includes:  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Handling Missing Data 
- Outlier removal  
- Normalization / scaling  
- Feature selection  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)  

Each team member contributed to one preprocessing technique, and together, we created a combined pipeline that generates a final clean dataset ready for model training.
